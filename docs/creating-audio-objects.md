# How to create audio objects using standard audio tools

Most adaptive podcasts will use audio files which are created in an audio editor such as Audacity. Turning them into audio objects can be difficult depending on the use planned in the podcast.

A podcast with minimal adaptations may not require many audio objects, while a podcast with lots of adaptations might require large numbers of objects.

For example, a comedy podcast might require lots of audio objects to fit the comic timing, since using text to speech will not give consistent results depending on the settings on the device: a slower text to speech will result in overlapping speech. Breaking the audio into objects gives you control over the timing.

In Audacity you can mark up sections of a recorded audio file.

Then export each section as an identifiable audio object, perfect for adaptive podcasting.
