# Communities using adaptive podcasting

The adaptive podcasting editor and player app are completely new and experimental prototype tools. They may contain bugs. However, the best way to stay in contact with further developments is to join a community of people building their own adaptive podcasts. A community can learn quicker by sharing experiences, code, and tips to get the most out of the web editor, code and player application.

Access to the Community is completely optional but worth joining for updates on the project, and to be inspired by what others create and do.
