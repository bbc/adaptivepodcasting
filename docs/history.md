Established in 2011 following the public research into a branch of object based media, called Perceptive media.
BBC R&D designed and created the first [Perceptive Radio](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/perceptive-radio) with Mudlark, MCQN, Deferred Procrastination from across the North of England in [2013](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2013-05-collaborative-working-on-perceptive-radio).
Following this a second Perceptive Radio with Lancaster University, Glasgow University and Mudlark in [2016](https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/perceptive-media(ca8f7144-86d4-4b74-a36a-a5473343b395).html).

By 2016, smartphone capability had grown to an extent to which a mobile app could reproduce most of the fuctionality of the Perceptive Radio and could provide a framework for creating adaptive audio experiences for everyone.

In Aug 2021, Adaptive podcasting recieved support from the [European Broadcasting Union](https://www.ebu.ch/) [(EBU)'s media innovation fund](https://www.ebu.ch/media/media-innovation-fund), providing the whole code base to EBU members 12 months ahead of the public open source release. The 12 months co-insided with the release of the [Android player on the Android play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.bbc.perceptivepodcasts) and marked with a [R&D blog post](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2022-09-adaptive-podcasting).

In October 2023, the code bases for [Adaptive podcasting were combined and made public](https://github.com/bbc/adaptivepodcasting) under an Apache 2 licence along with other [related research](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/adaptive-podcasting-open-source-release).
