This is a short summary of the history of Perceptive/Adaptive podcasting starting from the [Perceptive Radio project](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/perceptive-radio). More technical details can be found in the [roadmap](roadmap.md).

## 2011

Established in 2011 following the public research into a branch of object based media, called [Perceptive media](https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2012/07/what-is-perceptive-media.shtml) and the first [public prototype breaking out](https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2012/07/breaking-out---an-audio-experi.shtml). The ([code base](https://github.com/happyworm/PerceptiveMedia)) from [Happyworm](http://happyworm.com/) are both available.

## 2013

BBC R&D designed and created the first [Perceptive Radio](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/perceptive-radio) with Mudlark, MCQN, Deferred Procrastination from across the North of England in [2013](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2013-05-collaborative-working-on-perceptive-radio).

## 2016

Following this a second Perceptive Radio with Lancaster University, Glasgow University and Mudlark in [2016](https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/perceptive-media(ca8f7144-86d4-4b74-a36a-a5473343b395).html).

Smartphone capability had grown to an extent to which a mobile app could reproduce most of the fuctionality of the Perceptive Radio and could provide a framework for creating adaptive audio experiences for everyone.

## 2017

In the summer, a live brief around the perceptive radio with Manchester Metropolian University leads to a summer placement of Chris Bergin who worked on the very first Android player. Android was chosen due to development effort, importance of putting the early releases in the hands of young people, diversity of devices and cost of handsets.

Ben Newcombe internally on placement to R&D adding the data merchant system. Later that year a chance hackathon event with Rebecca Saw arranged by the University of York, lead to contunious development and over the coming years  

## 2018

With a stable APK, a number of community engagement started including with the University of Salford with 3 audio students creating time based adaptive podcasts. 2 of which are in the default RSS feed. Rebecca Saw worked on the stability and more features. Rebecca also independantly started a web editor, which became the base of the currently editor.

## 2019

Development of the player is given to Trunk's Nathan Broadbent and Alex Stone, while Rebecca Saw's editor is picked up and further developed. Giving non-developers a easy way to get started and understand the perceptive podcasting project.

## 2020
The project name Perceptive podcasting is changed to a more descriptive Adaptive podcasting. A brand is created by Jimmy Lee and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTAryDY3YTQ) is produced during the pandemic. 2020 is also the first year the community of practice named rabbit holes collective is formed with artists from Bristol & Bath's creative community. 

## 2021
In Aug 2021, Adaptive podcasting recieved support from the [European Broadcasting Union](https://www.ebu.ch/) [(EBU)'s media innovation fund](https://www.ebu.ch/media/media-innovation-fund), providing the whole code base to EBU members 12 months ahead of the public open source release.

## 2022
The first edition of the Adaptive podcasting player is made available in the [Google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.bbc.perceptivepodcasts). The web editor is made available under the [BBC's Makerbox project](https://www.bbc.co.uk/makerbox/tools/adaptive-podcasting). This is marked with a [R&D blog post](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2022-09-adaptive-podcasting).

## 2023
University of York's and BBC R&D's codebase are merged and made open source under the Apache licence. A promotional [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZvlezILOw).
