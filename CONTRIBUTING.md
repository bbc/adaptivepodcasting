## Reviewing contributions

We will review contribitions and there is a process which involves at least 1 contributor, usually a BBC employee. This process can take time based on the size, complexity and type of the contribution, resource and time from our side. With large complex contributions, we recommend starting a seperate issue around resourcing referencing the contribution.

We highly recommend file formats where the changes within the files can be easily viewed and understood in plain text by any knowledgeable person.
